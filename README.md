# face_detection
In this Jupyter notebook I have created a utility that can Detect face(s) of people in images and then Extract and Save those as images using MTCNN (Multi-task Cascaded Convolutional Neural Networks) and OpenCV

- Open this notebook in Google Colab
- Require images to be loaded to Google Drive
